@title{Kettle: Terminal User Interface Library}
@author{Anthony Green}

@defmodule[kettle]

Kettle is a Racket library for building rich Terminal User Interfaces
(TUIs). It implements the TEA (The Elm Architecture) pattern---model,
update, view---for reactive terminal applications. Kettle is a port of
the Common Lisp @tt{cl-tuition} library.

The name ``Kettle'' comes from the fact that a kettle makes TEA.

;; A scope set is represented as a list of scopes sorted by decreasing
;; scope id, plus a count and an order-independent hash code that is
;; maintained incrementally: each scope has a pseudo-random key, and
;; the set's code is the `fxxor` of its scopes' keys (as in Zobrist
;; hashing).
;;
;; New scopes have larger ids, and most operations add, remove, or
;; flip a scope that is among the most recent few in a set. With
;; the most recent scope first, those operations allocate only a few
;; pairs, and the result shares its tail with the original set.
;; Shared tails also let equality and subset tests stop early. The
;; hash code makes `equal?`-based hashing on scope sets constant time,
;; and it lets `scope-set=?` reject almost every pair of distinct sets
;; without looking at elements. The most recent scope, which is where
;; bindings are attached, is the first element.
;;
;; The representation relies on these properties of scopes:
;;
;;  * Distinct scopes have distinct ids, so that the sorted list for
;;    a set is unique. (The id counter in "../syntax/scope.rkt" is
;;    shared by all places and threads.)
;;
;;  * A scope's id and key never change.
;;
;; Scope sets are immutable, so they are safe to share among threads.
;; An operation that changes an old scope in a large set copies the
;; pairs for all of the newer scopes, so it takes time proportional
;; to the number of newer scopes.
